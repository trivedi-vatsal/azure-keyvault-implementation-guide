## What is Azure Key Vault?

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides secure storage for:

- **Secrets**: Passwords, API keys, connection strings
- **Keys**: Cryptographic keys for encryption/decryption
- **Certificates**: SSL/TLS certificates

### Why Use Key Vault?

- **Security**: Secrets are encrypted and access is controlled
- **Centralized Management**: All secrets in one place
- **Audit Trail**: Track who accessed what and when
- **Integration**: Works with Azure services and applications
- **Compliance**: Helps meet security and compliance requirements

## Getting Access

### Step 1: Request Access

1. **Identify Your Needs**:
   - What secrets do you need access to?
   - What's your business justification?
   - How long do you need access?

2. **Submit Request**:
   - Email: `it-servicedesk@company.com`
   - Subject: `AKV Access Request - {Team} - {Resource} - {Your Name}`
   - Include manager approval

3. **Wait for Approval**:
   - IT Security will review your request
   - You'll be added to the appropriate security group
   - You'll receive confirmation when access is granted

### Step 2: Install Required Tools

1. Go to [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9mz794c6t74m)
